This is a simple Flutter application built for learning purposes. The app is a Kanban board that allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks using the Kanban methodology.

The app is built using Clean Architecture, which separates the application into layers and ensures that each layer has a clear responsibility. The app also uses Use Cases to define the business logic and Cubits to manage the application state.
